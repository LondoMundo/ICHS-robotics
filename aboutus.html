        <p>Spartronics is the new Imlay City FIRST robotics team. We are composed of students from the Imlay City High School and mentored by Don Heeke, a teacher at the High School. FIRST robotics is a multi-national non-profit organization that aspires to transform culture of science and technology. They try to make science, math, engineerign and technology fun for kids. The students on the robotics team design a robot from scratch. They design the parts with CAD software used in the real world, machine the parts, assemble the parts, program the robot to do certain tasks. Students participating in the business side of things will take part in planning and community outreach programs. Some of the most important things that the students learn is teamwork and "gracious professionalism"</p>
