    This year, our challenge is to put a ball into a goal on one end of the field. It sounds pretty boring, but it's actually pretty awesome. Our robot has to collaborate a lot with two other robots to get the ball into the goal. At the start of the game there is a 10 second Autonomous Period where the robots have to act on their own, without any human interaction to try to score goals. After this period is over, human drivers take over. The human drivers must pilot the robot  to cooperate with other robots in our alliance. The more times that we assist teams on our alliance, the more points our alliance gets for scoring the ball.
